Session sticky ness:
=====================
  Means -> while load balancing servers 01A and 01B are maintaining the applications 
  If request is going to server 01A then all requests must go to same 01A server so the session is maintain in 01A server.
  If the same request going to 01B then there is no session available in server 01B server
  
  so, response is back as session expires on the clint side.
