==================== 
    Write CustomExceptions class. 
    Diff b/w checked and unchecked Exception. 
    Prepare for coding examples.     

Serialization: 
=================== 
    Diff b/w Serialization and Externalizable 
    Why we need Externalizable 
    purpose of static and transient key words.
